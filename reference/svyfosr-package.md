# svyfosr: Survey-Weighted Function on Scalar Regression

Uses the fast univariate inference ('FUI') framework to implement
(complex) survey-weighted function on scalar regression. It also
provides tools for visualizing and interpreting the results of these
models. The 'FUI' framework is based on the idea of fitting a series of
univariate models to the data, which can be done quickly and
efficiently. This approach allows for the incorporation of survey
weights and design effects into the analysis, making it suitable for
complex survey data. The package includes functions for fitting the
models, as well as functions for visualizing the results and assessing
model fit. Overall, this package provides a powerful tool for analyzing
complex survey data using function on scalar regression models.
